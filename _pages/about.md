Hello! I am a Researcher at [Samsung AI Center](https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/saithome/main/main.do) in Suwon, South Korea.

I received a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Automotive Software Design. Previously, I was a research intern at KETI (Korea Electronics Technology Institute).
