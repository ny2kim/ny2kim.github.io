Hello! I am a Researcher at [Samsung AI Center](https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/saithome/main/main.do) in Suwon, South Korea.

I received a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Automotive Software Design. Previously, I was a research intern at KETI (Korea Electronics Technology Institute), mentored by Dr. Mingyu Park. During the internship, I focused on unsupervised depth prediction and camera motion estimation.
I am interested in developing robust visual representations for embodied agents operating in real-world environments such as autonomous driving and robotics, using approaches from generative modeling and multi-modal learning.
