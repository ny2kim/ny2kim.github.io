Hello! I am a Researcher at [Samsung AI Center](https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/saithome/main/main.do).

I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering and minored in Automotive Software Design. I was a research intern at KETI (Korea Electronics Technology Institute).

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and #Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, #Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
